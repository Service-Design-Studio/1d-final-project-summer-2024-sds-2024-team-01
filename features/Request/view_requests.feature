# Feature: View Requests
#   As a volunteer
#   So that I can view requests made by users
#   I want to see the available requests made by the users

#   Background: Sign in with valid acct
#     Given I am logged in as "alice.smith@example.com" with nric "S1234567A"
    

#   # Happy Path Scenarios
#   Scenario: View requests
#     Given I am on the Ring of Reciprocity requests page
#     Then I should see a list of requests

 
# # Sad Path Scenarios
# Scenario: View user requests on the requests page with no requests available
#     Given I can see no requests available
#     Then I should see a message indicating no requests are currently available
